Here is a sample text to be used for translation purposes:

In the serene waters of a secluded lake, black swans glide with an elegance that belies their rarity. These majestic birds, with their sleek, onyx feathers and striking red beaks, stand as living symbols of the unexpected. Their discovery in Australia, after centuries of the Western world believing that all swans were white, serves as a stark reminder that the world is full of surprises, challenging our assumptions and expanding the horizons of what we consider possible.
